# NetworkAnalysis

## The architecture of this projects consists on scpripts that aid the analysis:
* dal.py and constants.py for connecting and querying the db.
* models.py and experiemnt_models.py are wrapers around networkX that make analysing and experienting with networks easier.
* ml_models.py are wrapers to experiment with different ML Models.
* utils.py stores functions that aid with data transfomations and building netowrks.
* plots.py is a centralised place that stores the fucntions to build all the plots I needed.

## Queries Folder
Inside this folder there are all the queries I used for the thesis.

## Research Folder
Here you can fined all the relevant notebooks used to analyse the data and perform all the experiemtns. The other_research subfolder stores all the research that did not make it to the thesis.
